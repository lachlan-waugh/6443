## dom-based xss

### dom-based xss

[XSS of a third kind](www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.html)

---

### quick recap
* reflected xss - non-persistent xss
* stored xss - persistent xss

> what are some strategies you've talked about to mitigate these?

---

### dom-based
the exploitation exists solely in the DOM
* this means the payloads, never hit the server
* it's moreso an issue of how client-side code parses input
* what issues can this cause?

---

### quick note
what is the difference between reflected and dom-based
* reflected: user input is reflected in the response returned from the server
* dom-based: the input never hits the server, and the vulnerability exists in the client-side

> why is what you see in inspect element (ctrl + shift + i) different to when you look at page source (ctrl + u)

---

### how do browsers work
* originally, that html document is just a text
* browsers are just html/css/js interpreters
    * originally browsers were the only js interpreters (v8, spidermonkey)
    * nodejs is a js runtime built to work outside of a browsers

---

### how does it interpret?
* the browser is a heirarchical tree, where each element (tag) is a node.
* each node is an object
* root nodes, child nodes, text nodes

---

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```
Document
 ├─ <html>
 │   ├─ <head>
 │   │   ├─ <title>My Page</title>
 │   ├─ <body>
 │       ├─ <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
 │       ├─ <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

---

### another thing to note
* browsers are really smart
* web programmers aren't
* often browsers will interpret broken code (mxss?) 
* sometimes the dom won't exactly match the html

> can you think of any other reasons why?

---

### defense
why could this inconsistency be difficult if you were trying to detect xss?

---

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        Hello
        <span>World</span>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2
    </ul>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Cell 1</td>
            <td>Cell 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

```
#document
└── html
    ├── head
    │   └── title ("DOM Example")
    ├── body
    │   ├── div
    │   │   ├── (text) "Hello"  ← Text node preserved
    │   │   ├── span
    │   │   │   └── (text) "World"
    │   ├── ul
    │   │   ├── li ("Item 1")
    │   │   ├── li ("Item 2")  ← The browser automatically closes the missing `</li>`

    │   │   │   │   ├── td ("Cell 1")
    │   │   │   │   ├── td ("Cell 2")
```

### what more can you do
create elements
```
let newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
newParagraph.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";
document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);
```

handle events
```
heading.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Heading clicked!");
});
```

blah blah blah

> you can run code

{{% /section %}}

---

{{% section %}}


---

### When is it vulnerable?

```js
div.innerHTML = window.location.search.substring(1).split("=")[1];
div.innerHTML = document.referrer;
div.innerHTML = window.location.hash.substring(1);
div.innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("userComment");
iframe.src = window.location.hash.substring(1);
let userInput = window.location.search.substring(1).split("=")[1];
eval("document.write('" + userInput + "')");
```

{{% /section %}}
