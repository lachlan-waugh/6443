### CVEs
Common Vulnerability Enumerations

> It's really important that the security community works together

### Application Security Testing
[SAST vs DAST tools](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/sast-vs-dast-difference/)
* *SAST*: full access to source-code (white box)
* *DAST*: just have the application (black box)
* *IAST*: runtime specific (e.g. only specific times)

## What makes a good app
{{% section %}}

### The fundamentals
* Availability :moneybag:
* Reliability :moneybag:
* Scalability :moneybag:
* ~~Security~~ :see_no_evil: :hear_no_evil: :speak_no_evil:

---

### At a high level
* UX/UI (e.g.
    [meme](https://www.art.yale.edu/)
    [meme2](https://www.art.yale.edu/about/about-this-site))
* [load speed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
* load balancing

### Supply chain attacks

> dependency stuffs

---

> Trusting code we didn't write ourselves

* npm
* pip/pypi
* pacman/aur
* cargo

---

### Vulnerabilities

* [log4j](https://www.upguard.com/blog/apache-log4j-vulnerability) (2 billion devices!!!)

* [pac-resolver](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/npm-package-with-3-million-weekly-downloads-had-a-severe-vulnerability/) (3 million weekly downloads)

---

### Malicious developers

* [node-ipc](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/node-ipc-protestware/) / [lovenotwar](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/lovenotwar)

---

### Dependency confusion
* `npm install xyz`
* how does it resolve `xyz`
* public & private version of `xyz`
* higher version number

### Typosquatting
* `pip install falsk`
* package named `falsk`:

## CI/CD
keeping it secure

* github actions ([ramble](https://github.com/lachlan-waugh/6443))
* [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/)
* `.gitignore`
* ~~[not this](https://github.com/mattdiamond/fuckitjs)~~

---

### what to keep secure
* tokens
* keys
* `.env`
* `.git`

> basically just \~secrets\~

### dumb projects idk

## Privilege escalation
what to do once you have RCE

* can execute arbitrary commands, but we're executing them as a lower-level user (e.g. `www-data` or `Nobody`)
* We want our commands to execute as root/admin/superuser

---

### How to privesc
* world-writable /etc/passwd (wait it is useful?)
* cronjob running as sudo
* setuid binaries
* commands run as root without password
* vulnerabilities in the kernel itself (dirtycow?)

---

### Docker escape

---

### Useful resources

* [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)
* [CDK](https://github.com/cdk-team/CDK#installationdelivery)
* [amicontained](https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained)
* [deepce](https://github.com/stealthcopter/deepce)

### what makes a secure web app

> ~~[technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc1P-AEaEp8)~~

* NGINX, [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) (TLS), Docker
* don't trust ~~user input~~ anybody (zero-trust)
* good access control
