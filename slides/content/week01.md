## Wargames
* Don't leave them to the last minute, you'll be sad :(

* Cool to collaborate/work together, but your flags need to be different.

* extended flags aren't *required\**, but you should do them anyway (they're way cooler imo)

## Report
* pentesting / vulnerability report
    * groups of 4-5
    * keep track of how you got found each of the flags
