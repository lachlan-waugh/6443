## Wargames
* don't leave them to the last minute, you'll be sad :(

* cool to collaborate/work together, but your flags need to be different.

* extended flags aren't *required*, but you should do them anyway (they're way cooler imo)

---

## Report
* pentesting / vulnerability report
    * groups of 3-4
    * keep track of how you got found each of the flags
    * threats and remediation are really important
