### what to talk about
* vulnerability details
* proof of concept / steps to Reproduce
* **impact** !important
* remediation

---

### Really consider the impact
* Order the report based on how damaging the vulnerabilities are
* Don't just include things we've talked about in lectures/tuts, discuss general security issues you came across
* Good explanation of the impact `>>>>` more flags

---

### what to include
> everythingâ„¢!!
* challenge solutions
* midterm solutions
* recon/haas solutions

---

## Reports
* keep it businessy & use a real vulnerability scoring system (e.g CVE), and framework (e.g NIST)
* "we recommend you keep a record of the vulnerabilities you have found. Most pen-testers will be required to write a report after a 'penetration assessment', and you will too during this semester!" - Topic 03 challenges on OL

---

## some example reports
* [an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s12Off74DZ8RcELdqdeZSxJTMkbN6l4MHtolwTUrnrU/edit)
* [some more examples](https://github.com/juliocesarfort/public-pentesting-reports)

* session tokens (e.g. Flask/Express)
* JWT (JSON Web Token)
* username=melon;password=Hunter2

---

### hacking cookies
* stealing cookies
    * cross-site scripting (XSS) [week7/8]
    * MITM attacks
    * cross-site request forgery (CSRF) [week7/8]
* forging cookies (called "baking")
* ~~accidentally~~ showing your cookies on screen during the tute (who would do that?? haha)

---

## securing cookies
* http-only (prevents XSS)
* secure (prevents MITM)
* same origin (prevents CSRF)
* expiry
