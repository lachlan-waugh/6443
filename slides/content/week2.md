## Reports

---

### what to talk about
* vulnerability details
* proof of concept / steps to Reproduce
* **impact** !important
* remediation

---

### Really consider the impact
* Order the report based on how damaging the vulnerabilities are
* Don't just include things we've talked about in lectures/tuts, discuss general security issues you came across
* Good explanation of the impact `>>>>` more flags

---

### what to include
> everythingâ„¢!!
* challenge solutions
* midterm solutions
* recon/haas solutions

---

### tldr
* keep it businessy & use a real vulnerability scoring system (e.g CVE), and framework (e.g NIST)
* "we recommend you keep a record of the vulnerabilities you have found. Most pen-testers will be required to write a report after a 'penetration assessment', and you will too during this semester!" - Topic 03 challenges on OL

---

### some example reports
* [an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s12Off74DZ8RcELdqdeZSxJTMkbN6l4MHtolwTUrnrU/edit)

## cookies
yum

---

### what are they?
* pieces of text sent by websites to your browser.
* help the website remember information about you
* a sense of **persistence** (HTTP is stateless)

---

### why do I care
often used to store session data

* session tokens (e.g. Flask/Express)
* JWT (JSON Web Token)
* username=melon;password=Hunter2

> often encrypted

---

### hacking cookies
* stealing cookies
    * cross-site scripting (XSS) [week7/8]
    * MITM attacks
    * cross-site request forgery (CSRF) [week7/8]
* forging cookies (called "baking")
* bruteforcing keys?

---

## securing cookies
the following attributes for cookies mean they are only sent:

* http-only: over http (not accessible by js)
* secure: over `https://` (not `http://`)
* expiry: if they isn't expired
* same site: *next slide*

---

### same site
* *none*: cookies are always sent
* *lax*:  (default) not sent cross-site
    * images/iframes *`no`*
    * navigation (GET)    *`yes`*
* *strict*: cookies aren't sent

## bruteforcing & scripting

### frist of all
"*N.B. Both sub-domain enumeration and sub-directory brute-forcing are discouraged and will not assist you in these challenges. However, you may be find it useful to enumerate IDs or passwords.*" - Topic 3 challenges page on O
